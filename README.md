# FlightTracker
Welcome to the source code for the CDW Global flight tracker!

GETTING STARTED:

1. Log into/or create an account at https://aviationstack.com/ and generate your personal API key.

2. In the root directory create a config.js file and inside declare a variable called "AUTH_TOKEN" and assign it to your API key as a string.

3. Export the newly created variable using "export default".

4. Inside the database folder create a new file named db.config.js. Once created use "module.exports = {}" and inside the object input your MySQL credentials. 

If you have completed all of these steps successfully, congratulations! After compiling the files and initiating the server you should now be able to open a fully functional application in your browser.
